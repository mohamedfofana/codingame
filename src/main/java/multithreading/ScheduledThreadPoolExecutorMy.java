/**
 * What is ThreadPool in Java?
 * A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to 
 * the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing. Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, 
 * the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.
 * ava provides the Executor framework which is centered around the Executor interface, 
 * its sub-interface â€“ExecutorService and the class-ThreadPoolExecutor

	 * It creates a fixed-sized Thread Pool. So when it is initiated, it needs to be given the corePoolSize (the number of threads in the Thread pool).

	 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(int corePoolSize, ThreadFactory threadFactory) : Creates a new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor object with the given parameters. The first parameter is the size of the Thread Pool and the second parameter is a ThreadFactory object that is used when the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor creates a new thread.
	 * ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(int corePoolSize, RejectedExecutionHandler handler): Creates a new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor object with the given corePoolSize(ThreadPool size) and the handler that is used when the execution of a task is rejected (when the working queue is full or execution is blocked).
